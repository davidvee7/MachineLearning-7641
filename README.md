# MachineLearning-7641
I conducted an analysis of supervised machine learning techniques (support vector machines, neural nets, boosting, decision 
trees, KNN) and unsupervised machine learning techniques (ICM, PCM, feature selection) for two distinct problems: 
  a) Whether or not a person makes more than $50k annually, and
  b) How much a house costs in King County, California.
